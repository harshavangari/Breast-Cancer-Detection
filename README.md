### Breast Cancer Detection System
## Overview
This project aims to develop a breast cancer detection system using machine learning techniques. The system consists of frontend and backend components. The frontend is built using Vue.js and Vite, while the backend is implemented in Python.

## Frontend
The frontend component contains the following files and directories:

public: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, or other resources used by the frontend.
src: Contains the source code for the Vue.js application.
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
package.json: The npm package file that specifies the dependencies and scripts for building and running the frontend.
package-lock.json: Auto-generated file that locks the dependencies versions.
vite.config.js: Configuration file for Vite, the frontend build tool.
## Backend
The backend component contains the following files and directories:

saved_model: Directory containing saved machine learning models or other pre-trained models used by the backend.
main.py: The main Python script that implements the backend functionality.
requirements.txt: File listing the Python dependencies required by the backend. These can be installed using pip.
## Usage
To run the breast cancer detection system, follow these steps:

## Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory (frontend).
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the development server using npm run dev.
Access the application at the specified URL (typically http://localhost:3000).
## Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory (backend).
Install Python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the backend server using python main.py.
Ensure that any required machine learning models are available in the saved_model directory.

## Notes
Customize the backend functionality in main.py according to the specific requirements of the breast cancer detection system.
Ensure that the required dependencies are installed and configured properly for both frontend and backend components.
Consider integrating additional features such as data visualization, result interpretation, or user authentication to enhance the usability of the system.
